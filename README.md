# @hdanyal-ts/paperclip-plugin-agentmail

**AgentMail → Paperclip work** in one bridge. Inbound mail becomes **issues** and **documents**; agents get **REST tools** to read threads and reply—without leaving your [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) control plane.

This is a **third-party** plugin (not an official `paperclipai` product). Canonical source: **[github.com/hdanyal-ts/paperclip-plugin-agentmail](https://github.com/hdanyal-ts/paperclip-plugin-agentmail)**. In-repo path in a Paperclip fork: `packages/plugins/plugin-agentmail-paperclip`.

| **Package name** (e.g. monorepo filter) | `@hdanyal-ts/paperclip-plugin-agentmail` |
| **Manifest / plugin id** | `hdanyal-ts.paperclip-plugin-agentmail` |
| **Distribution** | **[GitHub](https://github.com/hdanyal-ts/paperclip-plugin-agentmail)** (git tag or [Release](https://github.com/hdanyal-ts/paperclip-plugin-agentmail/releases) asset) — not published on the public npm registry |
| **Needs** | Paperclip-compatible host, **Node ≥ 20**, [`@paperclipai/plugin-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paperclipai/plugin-sdk) (fetched by `npm`/`pnpm` when installing from git, path, or a `.tgz`) |

Install patterns for any host are also covered in [THIRD_PARTY_PLUGINS.md](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/master/doc/plugins/THIRD_PARTY_PLUGINS.md) (upstream) or `doc/plugins/THIRD_PARTY_PLUGINS.md` in this monorepo.

## Install (choose one)

Use the same `PAPERCLIP_HOME` / environment as your running instance for CLI commands. This project is **not** published to the public **npm** registry; use **Git** or a **local path** (or a **`.tgz`** from a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/hdanyal-ts/paperclip-plugin-agentmail/releases) if you attach the CI `npm pack` output).

### 1. Git tag (recommended)

The Paperclip server runs `npm install` on the spec you pass—pin a **tag**.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<your-board-host>/api/plugins/install" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"packageName":"git+https://github.com/hdanyal-ts/paperclip-plugin-agentmail.git#v0.3.2"}'
```

**CLI** (match your board URL):

```bash
pnpm paperclipai plugin install "git+https://github.com/hdanyal-ts/paperclip-plugin-agentmail.git#v0.3.2"
```

Private repos: the **host** must reach GitHub (SSH, credential helper, or token). Do not commit tokens into shared config.

### 2. Release tarball (optional)

If a **`.tgz`** is attached to a [Release](https://github.com/hdanyal-ts/paperclip-plugin-agentmail/releases), you can point `packageName` at the **URL** of that file (or download it and use a local path) — same install pipeline as any npm-compatible package source.

### 3. Local path (dev / air-gapped)

Build first (`npm run build` → `dist/`).

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3100/api/plugins/install \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"packageName":"/absolute/path/to/paperclip-plugin-agentmail","isLocalPath":true}'
```

From this monorepo:

```bash
pnpm --filter @hdanyal-ts/paperclip-plugin-agentmail build
```

### Maintainers: GitHub releases

Source of truth is the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hdanyal-ts/paperclip-plugin-agentmail). Push `main` and create **version tags** (e.g. `v0.3.2`); the **Release** workflow runs tests, **`npm run build`**, and **`npm pack`**, and can upload the **`.tgz`** to the release. **Exporting** from a full Paperclip fork: [STANDALONE.md](./STANDALONE.md).

## How mail becomes work

```
AgentMail (inbox)  --webhook and/or websocket-->  plugin worker
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                              Paperclip issues
                                              + documents + comments
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                              Agent REST tools (reply, thread, etc.)
```

Live events drive the pipeline; if Paperclip was **down**, **unread catch-up** replays missed mail through the **same** ingest path.

---

## Upgrading from older plugin ids

If you used **`paperclipai.agentmail-paperclip`** or another old manifest id: **remove** the old instance in Plugin Manager, **reinstall**, re-apply settings, and point AgentMail at the current webhook:

`https://<your-board-host>/api/plugins/hdanyal-ts.paperclip-plugin-agentmail/webhooks/agentmail-inbound`

---

## What you get (v1)

- **Delivery you can mix:** **`message.received`** over **HTTPS webhooks** (Svix-signed) and/or an **outbound WebSocket** to AgentMail (`wss://…/v0` + per-inbox `am_…` key). Same `issues` + `issue.documents` pipeline; **`message_id`** dedup if you run **both** during a migration.
- **One issue per thread:** `agentmail.thread` maps `inbox_id:thread_id` to a single issue. Replies **comment**, bump the issue to **`todo`**, and re-run attachment ingest (so a late PDF still lands on the right card). Odd `thread_id` on a reply is merged using **`in_reply_to` / `references`**, or **`GET /messages/{id}`** when the webhook is thin. Stale thread rows fall back sensibly before opening a duplicate issue.
- **Attachments that actually show up:** Payloads are **merged** with `GET /messages/{id}`; ids accept `attachment_id`, `id`, or `attachmentId`. If both sides are empty briefly, the worker **retries** once after a short delay.
- **Dedup before noise:** `agentmail.message` tracks AgentMail `message_id` so replays do not duplicate work.
- **Routing:** `mailboxes[]` / `assignments[]`, plus optional **`recipientMatch`** when humans share one inbox.
- **Operator context:** `handlingInstructions` fold into the issue description.
- **Agent tools (REST):** `agentmail_get_handling_context`, `agentmail_list_messages`, `agentmail_get_message`, **`agentmail_get_thread`**, `agentmail_send_message`, `agentmail_reply_to_message`. Tool names are **`hdanyal-ts.paperclip-plugin-agentmail:<bare_name>`**. Inbound issues carry an **`### AgentMail`** block. For prompt examples, see `skills/paperclip/SKILL.md` in a full Paperclip checkout.
- **Spam guard:** optional **skip issue creation** when labels match `attachmentPolicy.skipIfLabels` (default includes spam-like labels).
- **Unread catch-up** and **blog dedupe** (optional)—see below.

## Unread catch-up and wakeup sync

If Paperclip or the worker **is not running**, webhooks and WS frames do not run—but **mail still arrives** in AgentMail, often as **`unread`**. This plugin **catches up** by listing unread mail per mailbox and feeding it through the **same ingest code** as live traffic (internal source `catchup`, ids like `catchup:{message_id}`). Existing **`message_id`** dedup keeps reruns safe.

**When it runs**

| Trigger | What happens |
|--------|----------------|
| **Worker startup** | **Sync unread on startup** (default **on**) kicks a pass after the worker is up. |
| **Config saved** | With startup sync on, saving settings triggers a pass (useful after mailbox edits). |
| **Scheduled job** | Job key **`unread_sync`** (“Unread mail reconciliation”) runs on a **once-per-minute** host schedule. **`unreadSyncIntervalSeconds`** (default **300**) throttles how often a **scheduled** run does real work after the last one. Set to **0** to **disable that throttle** (job can work every tick, still capped per mailbox and by the lock)—**not** a no-op. |
| **Manual** | In **Plugin Manager → this plugin → Settings**, **Sync unread now** runs immediately and returns JSON; the UI can show the last **sync summary**. |

**Settings** (also in the **Catch-up** card in the UI; full schema: `instanceConfigSchema` in `src/manifest.ts`):

- **`unreadSyncOnStartup`** — Run on worker start and after config change when `true` (default `true`).
- **`unreadSyncIntervalSeconds`** — Minimum gap between **scheduled** runs that process work (`0`–`86400`, default `300`). Does not slow **startup** or **manual** sync.
- **`unreadSyncMaxPerRun`** — Max messages **per mailbox** per run (`1`–`500`, default `50`) so one huge backlog cannot wedged the worker.

**Safety + visibility**

- A **distributed lock** (instance state) prevents overlapping catch-up; if the lock is held, another run may log and exit early.
- Per-run **stats** feed the “last unread sync summary” for the UI.

**Marking read:** after a successful catch-up ingest, the worker can strip AgentMail’s **`unread`** label, same rules as live mail. If **blog dedupe** is on, **`blogDedupe.markReadOnDuplicate`** decides whether duplicates should still clear `unread` (default: clear).

---

## Blog dedupe (optional)

Optional **fingerprinting** for blog-style mail: title+body (or PDF/DOCX text), optional **sitemap** URL checks, optional small **visibility issues** when duplicates are detected. Same pipeline as webhooks—**including catch-up**. Fields: **`blogDedupe.enabled`**, **`sitemapUrls`**, **`markReadOnDuplicate`**, **`createIssueForDuplicate`**, plus extraction limits—see the settings form and `src/manifest.ts`.

---

## Security

- Treat **`am_…`** inbox keys and **`whsec_…`** webhook secrets as **secrets**; use Paperclip **secret references** for webhook material, not plaintext in repos.
- Prefer **HTTPS** for the board host; lock down who may call **`/api/plugins/install`**.

---

## Event delivery: webhook vs WebSocket

| | Webhook (default) | WebSocket |
|---|-------------------|-----------|
| **Inbound URL** | Public `POST` on your Paperclip host | None — worker dials **out** to AgentMail |
| **Trust** | Svix signature (`whsec_…`) | TLS + inbox key in the WS URL (no Svix on frames) |
| **When to use** | Common in production | Dev, tight egress, or “no public URL” setups — [AgentMail WebSockets](https://docs.agentmail.to/websockets/quickstart.md) |

In settings, **Event delivery** is `webhook`, `websocket`, or `both` (duplicates dedupe on `message_id`).

---

## Configure (checklist)

1. For **webhook** or **both**: store AgentMail’s **`whsec_…`** as a Paperclip **secret**; put its **reference** in **Webhook secret ref**. Put each inbox **`am_…`** key in the mailbox row (plugin config).
2. **Plugin Manager → AgentMail → Settings → Core:** **Company ID**, **Event delivery**, webhook ref, and optional **WebSocket URL**, **default project**, **API base**, **title prefix**.
3. **Mailboxes:** inboxes, assignments, optional **Only when addressed to** for shared inboxes.
4. **Save configuration.**
5. In **AgentMail**, set the **Inbound URL** from the plugin’s Webhook card:  
   `https://<your-board-host>/api/plugins/hdanyal-ts.paperclip-plugin-agentmail/webhooks/agentmail-inbound`  
   (If your host uses an install-specific path, use the URL the UI shows.)

---

## HTTP semantics (Paperclip host)

Happy path (worker finishes without throwing) → **200**. Verification failures **throw** → host may return **502** (provider may retry).
